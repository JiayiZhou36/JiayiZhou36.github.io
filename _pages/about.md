Welcome! I'm Jiayi Zhou. "Why should I trust the model?" This question drives much of my work in machine learning and interdisciplinary research. I focus on designing systems that are both **accurate and interpretable**, bridging the gap between technical models and practitioners who rely on them. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and applied data science, with a central emphasis on **interpretability, transparency, and usability**.  

A data-driven personal website
======
This website serves as a portfolio of my research, projects, and publications. Here, you can explore my work on **explainable AI**, **object detection**, and **data science pipelines** applied across diverse domains, from ecology to autonomous systems. I aim to make machine learning tools accessible, reproducible, and impactful for non-technical audiences while maintaining scientific rigor.

Key Projects & Focus Areas
------
- **Explainable AI:** Deploying methods such as LIME and attribution techniques for object detection models to produce clear, instance-aware explanations for domain experts.  
- **Computer Vision & Object Detection:** Evaluating 2D vs 3D detection models, designing pipelines for wildlife detection, and integrating explainability to uncover systematic errors.  
- **Interdisciplinary Applications:** Collaborating with researchers across law, ecology, and art to ensure AI tools are trustworthy and usable in real-world contexts.  
- **Research & Engineering Pipelines:** Building end-to-end reproducible software workflows for training, evaluation, and visualization, enabling others to apply models without requiring deep technical expertise.  

Professional Philosophy
------
I am motivated to create **machine learning systems that are transparent, reliable, and usable**, helping researchers and practitioners understand model decisions and trust their outcomes. By combining rigorous experimentation, practical tool-building, and collaboration with experts in other domains, I aim to ensure that AI solutions are not only technically sophisticated but also meaningful and responsible in their applications.
