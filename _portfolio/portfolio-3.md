This project focused on **classifying artworks** based on their genre and the emotions they evoke. Leveraging **transfer learning** and pre-trained models, we explored how art genres relate to the emotional responses they elicit.  

Using a combination of **WikiArt** pieces and **Artemis** annotations, we fine-tuned **ResNet50 models** to classify artworks into positive or negative emotional categories across four genres. Results showed that incorporating genre information improves classification accuracy. Additionally, sequential training of convolutional blocks yielded better performance than simultaneous block training, providing insights into model configuration strategies for emotion classification in art.  

This project highlights the intersection of **machine learning, computer vision, and computational creativity**, demonstrating how AI can help understand subjective human experiences like emotional responses to art.
