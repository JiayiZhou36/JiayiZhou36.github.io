title: "2D vs 3D Object Detection for Occluded Objects"
excerpt: "Year-long capstone project analyzing 2D and 3D object detection models under occlusion.

For my **year-long master capstone project**, my team examined the performance differences between **2D and 3D object detection models** when identifying partially occluded objects. 

We found that while 3D models such as **BEVFormer** can reconstruct obstructed scenes and perform better under severe occlusion, they require significantly more computational resources and expertise to use. Surprisingly, 2D models like **YOLO** outperformed 3D models on clear or mildly occluded objects, as 3D reconstruction sometimes introduced distortions leading to inaccurate predictions.  

Through stakeholder discussions, I learned that many real-world users prioritize models that are **easy to implement** and require minimal data preprocessing or coding. This experience deepened my interest in developing machine learning tools that **balance accuracy, efficiency, and usability**.
