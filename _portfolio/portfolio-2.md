For my undergraduate **statistics capstone project**, I collaborated with law professors to analyze **ten years of felony case activity reports** across North Carolina counties. Our goal was to identify trends and key factors influencing criminal trial rates.  

Because our collaborators had limited backgrounds in modeling, I employed a **decision tree** to explain the variation in trial rates. Its intuitive and visual nature allowed non-technical audiences to understand how different factors contributed to outcomes, without relying on complex mathematical formalism.  

This project sparked my interest in using **interpretable models** to bridge communication gaps between technical and non-technical domains, highlighting the importance of transparency and accessibility in applied data science.
